/**
 * <p>
 * The ValidatorPlugin interface allows Padlock developers to write plugins that are executed by the
 * Validator. These plugins can be added by calling addPlugin() on the Validator instance. Added plugins will
 * be executed after Padlock's built in checks have taken place. This means that by the time a plugin is
 * executed, the plugin can be assured that the license has passed all authenticity and validity checks. This
 * means the license signature matches and the valiation time falls within the License's validity period.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each ValidatorPlugin must return a {@link TestResult} instance, containing a specific test identifier
 * (chosen by the developer) and the result of the validation attempt. If any of Padlock's built in plugins or
 * the added plugins return a test failure, the license is considered invalid.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here's a real world example of one of Padlock's plugins, the BlacklistPlugin, which checks to see if a
 * license is on the Validator's blacklist. Note that development code is shown, the actual shipping code may
 * be different:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public final class BlacklistPlugin implements ValidatorPlugin {
 * 
 *     private static final String NAME = &quot;Padlock Blacklist Plugin&quot;;
 * 
 *     private static final String DESCRIPTION = &quot;Built in plugin that searches for licenses matching a&quot;
 *                                               + &quot;user defined blacklist&quot;;
 * 
 *     private final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass().getName());
 * 
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public TestResult validate(License license, ValidationParameters validationParameters) {
 *         boolean passed = true;
 * 
 *         Set&lt;String&gt; blacklist = validationParameters.getBlacklist();
 * 
 *         String signature = license.getLicenseSignatureString();
 *         if (blacklist.contains(signature)) {
 *             logger.fine(&quot;Found blacklisted license: &quot; + signature);
 *             passed = false;
 *         }
 * 
 *         return new TestResult(LicenseTest.BLACKLIST, passed);
 *     }
 * 
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public String getName() {
 *         return NAME;
 *     }
 * 
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public String getDescription() {
 *         return DESCRIPTION;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Instances of each test Padlock performs can be found as static members of the
 * {@link net.padlocksoftware.padlock.license.LicenseTest} class. This makes for easy determination of which
 * tests have passed and failed if you need fine grained resulsts.
 * </p>
