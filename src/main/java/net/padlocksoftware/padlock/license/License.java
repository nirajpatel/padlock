/**
 * <p>
 * Instances of the License interface are the primary means of customizing licenses. These can be created
 * through the LicenseFactory class and imported/exported through the LicenseIO class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All licenses must have a creation date and a start date. If neither are specified at the time of license
 * instantation, the current date will be used for both. Licenses may also be given an optional expiration
 * date. Licences may also be set with a floating expiration date, which is the period of time a license is
 * valid after the first time it's run through the validator. This is the easiest method of creating a time
 * limited day demo.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Licenses can be given any number of customizable properties. The contents of these properties are of no
 * concern to the validator, they exist strictly for customer defined plugins and the customer application.
 * Padlock does guarantee the validity of these properties, however. If any property key or value is changed,
 * added, or removed the license will fail to validate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Licenses are freely modifiable until they've been signed with a private key, at which point they act (and
 * should be treated as) an immutable class. Any attempt to modify a signed license will cause an exception to
 * be thrown. See the various method docs for details.
 * </p>
