/**
 * <p>
 * The LicenseState class represents the results of a Validation attempt on a license. Each time
 * Validator.validate() is called, an Instance of LicenseState provides fine grained test results. This is
 * returned either explicity through the Validator.validate() method or can be grabbed as a member object of
 * the ValidatorException instance thrown during a failed validation attempt.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A LicenseState instance contains an immutable collection of {@link TestResult}, with each TestResult item
 * containing the results of a specific test performed by the Validator. See both the Validator and TestResult
 * pages for details on their usages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * LicenseState instances should only be created internally by the Padlock library. There are no known use
 * cases where third party developers would need to explicitly instantiate a LicenseState object.
