/**
 * <p>
 * A LicenseTest instance is the fundamental result unit of the Padlock validation process. Each phase of the
 * validation process can be summarized with a LicenseTest instance. As the
 * {@link net.padlocksoftware.padlock.validator.Validator} progresses, instances of LicenseTest are created
 * and added to a {@link TestResult} instance.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Padlock has a number of predefined LicenseTest types, which are all defined as public static members of
 * this class. This is done for the convenience of Padlock customers who may want to look through validation
 * results for more details. Instances are compared for equality based strictly on the 'id' field of the
 * LicenseTest object. The following code sample shows how to check a failed validation attempt for the
 * results of the Padlock Hardware test:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Assume a ready validation instance
 * LicenseState state = null;
 * try {
 *     state = validator.validate();
 *     logger.info(&quot;All tests passed, enable full functionality.&quot;);
 * } catch (ValidatorException e) {
 *     state = ex.getLicenseState();
 *     if (state.getFailedTests().contains(LicenseTest.HARDWARE)) {
 *         logger.info(&quot;Hardware test failed, just thought you should know.&quot;);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Padlock only utilizes the static, immutable LicenseTest instances shown in the 'Field Summary' below. This
 * makes for easy comparisons and inquiries into the results of Padlock's built in tests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Developers who are creating their own {@link net.padlocksoftware.padlock.validator.ValidatorPlugin} classes
 * need to simply create instances of this class with the appropriate constructor parameters.
 * </p>
